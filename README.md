Project0 : Console Banking app 


As a user, I can:

- register a new user account with the system (must be secured with a password)
- login with my existing credentials
- create at least one account
- deposit funds into an account (use doubles, not ints)
- withdraw funds from an account (no overdrafting!)
- view the balance of my account(s) (all balance displays must be in proper currency format)

potential features
- view the transaction history for an account
- create multiple accounts per user (checking, savings, etc.)
- share a joint account with another user
- transfer money between accounts


Minumum features 

 - Use of custom data structures (do not use java.util Collection types!)
 - Basic validation of user input (e.g. no registration for classes outside of registration window, no negative deposits/withdrawals, no overdrafting, etc.)
 - Unit tests for all business-logic classes and DAOs
 - All exceptions are properly caught and handled
 - Proper use of OOP principles
 - Documentation (all classes and methods have basic documentation)
 - Database is 3rd Normal Form Compliant
 - Referential integrity (e.g. if a class is removed from the catalog, no students should be registered for it)
 - Logging exceptions to a file using a custom logger
 - Generation of basic design documents (e.g. relational diagram, class diagram, flows, etc.)
